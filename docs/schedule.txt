		Questions for Bryan
			Data sanitization
				What format would you like for phone numbers?
					One idea would be that an entry of "503-654-9482" would be stripped of formatting "5036549482" and then formatted appropriately "(503) 654-9482"
					Another example: "52 971 314.1592" -> "529713141592" -> "+52 (971) 314-1592"
					This would allow searching for specific international codes like "+52" or area codes like "(971)"
				Do we need to search for addresses of specific states?
					Right now, we can only search for 'OR' which will match 'Hawthorne Blvd'
				Are there any other fields that should be sanitized?
			Thief list
				What columns should show in the thief list page?
				What fields should be searchable? All of them?
					Thief Id,Name,Email,Url,Address,Phone,Bike Serial,Phrase,Notes
			Verbiage
				How much verbiage do you plan on putting on each page?
				How would you like them to look?
			Backups
				Should we make data backups?
				Should we backup files that were uploaded?
			History log
				What would you like to track in the history log?
					We are thinking of having a separate page with a table (possibly searchable?):
					Datetime | User | Action (delete or add) | New thief or deleted thief? | ThiefID | Data type | Data
					( Bryan deletes the thief )
					2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'delete' | 'deleting' | 3 | 'note' | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
					2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'delete' | 'deleting' | 3 | 'name' | 'John Smith'

					( rjones changes the note to 'hillsboro oregon fence' )
					2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'add'    |            | 3 | 'note' | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
					2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'delete' |            | 3 | 'note' | 'fence'

					( Bryan adds thief 'John Smith' with a note of 'fence' )
					2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add'    | 'new'      | 3 | 'note' | 'fence'
					2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add'    | 'new'      | 3 | 'name' | 'John Smith'
				Would you like to see the user and date of edit for each field on the thief edit page?
					We are thinking of adding the info to the right of the fields:
					Name  [ John Smith               ] [+] [-]     bhance    8/8/23
					Notes [ hillsboro oregon fence   ] [+] [-]     rjones    8/10/23
				Should we show the most recent editor for each thief on the thief list page?
				How important is all of this history logging?
		Bruce
		Cheng
			File uploads
				x Allow other files (pdfs, etc)
				x Automatically upload file upon a file select? Automatically go to file select upon + click.
			Thief List
				~ Put prev/next buttons in a static location?
				x Test search functionality
				x Move pages functionality to backend (page=2)
				~ Show how many results
				x Universal search
				Sorting functionality
					Closest match
					Recency
					Thief id
					Alphabetically
				Add other field types to the search type drop-down (Thief Id,Name,Email,Url,Address,Phone,Bike Serial,Phrase,Notes)
		Cristian
			x Editable text boxes on each page
			~ User List
				x Add column order functionality to link table (that doesn't throw errors)
				x User list doesn't update when changing search type (with search text entered)
				x User listing search put parameters into url
				Clean up code
			Thief Edit
				Grey out Submit button until changes are made. Put red border on changed fields.
				Add ability to collapse the many rows of urls (any fields over 8, scroll bar or collapse)
				(Front end) 'Clear all' button for fields (still needs submit, boots them to thief list when all fields are empty)
				Admin ability to change thief id field to combine multiple thieves (this might work by just making thief id an editable field?) (merge in history log?)
			History page
				Datetime            | User     | Action            | ThiefID | Data type | Data
				( Bryan deletes the thief )
				2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'remove (delete)' | 3       | 'note'    | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
				2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'remove (delete)' | 3       | 'name'    | 'John Smith'
				( rjones changes the note to 'hillsboro oregon fence' )
				2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'add'             | 3       | 'note'    | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
				2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'remove'          | 3       | 'note'    | 'fence'
				( Bryan adds thief 'John Smith' with a note of 'fence' )
				2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add (new)'       | 3       | 'note'    | 'fence'
				2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add (new)'       | 3       | 'name'    | 'John Smith'

				Create a history page (sort by recency)
				Button on theif edit page to go to history page filtered by theif id
				Button on user  edit page to go to history page filtered by user

					Leaving off: thiefDataImport and thiefEdit need to be combined to one interface now

					function standardizePhoneNum(text: string): string {
						// only keep digits, reverse order
						let digits = text.replace(/\D/g, '').split('').reverse().join('');
						let output = '';
						let i;
						for (i = 1; i <= digits.length; i++) { // 1-based index
							if (i == 5 ) { output = '-'  + output; }
							if (i == 8 ) { output = ') ' + output; }
							if (i == 11) { output = ' '  + output; }
							output = digits[i-1] + output;
							if (i == 10) { output = '('  + output; }
						}
						if (i == 9 || i == 10) { output = '(' + output; }
						if (i >= 12) { output = '+' + output; }
						return output;
