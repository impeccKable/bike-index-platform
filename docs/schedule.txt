		Questions for Bryan
			Data sanitization
				What format would you like for phone numbers?
					One idea would be that an entry of "503-654-9482" would be stripped of formatting "5036549482" and then formatted appropriately "(503) 654-9482"
					Another example: "52 971 314.1592" -> "529713141592" -> "+52 (971) 314-1592"
					This would allow searching for specific international codes like "+52" or area codes like "(971)"
				Do we need to search for addresses of specific states?
					Right now, we can only search for 'OR' which will match 'Hawthorne Blvd'
				Are there any other fields that should be sanitized?
			Thief list
				What columns should show in the thief list page?
				What fields should be searchable? All of them?
					Thief Id,Name,Email,Url,Address,Phone,Bike Serial,Phrase,Notes
			Verbiage
				How much verbiage do you plan on putting on each page?
				How would you like them to look?
			Backups
				Should we make data backups?
				Should we backup files that were uploaded?
			History log
				What would you like to track in the history log?
					We are thinking of having a separate page with a table (possibly searchable?):
					Datetime | User | Action (delete or add) | New thief or deleted thief? | ThiefID | Data type | Data
					( Bryan deletes the thief )
					2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'delete' | 'deleting' | 3 | 'note' | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
					2023-08-14 14:28:52 | 'bhance' | 'delete' | 'deleting' | 3 | 'name' | 'John Smith'

					( rjones changes the note to 'hillsboro oregon fence' )
					2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'add'    |            | 3 | 'note' | 'hillsboro oregon fence'
					2023-08-10 13:02:27 | 'rjones' | 'delete' |            | 3 | 'note' | 'fence'

					( Bryan adds thief 'John Smith' with a note of 'fence' )
					2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add'    | 'new'      | 3 | 'note' | 'fence'
					2023-08-08 17:06:48 | 'bhance' | 'add'    | 'new'      | 3 | 'name' | 'John Smith'
				Would you like to see the user and date of edit for each field on the thief edit page?
					We are thinking of adding the info to the right of the fields:
					Name  [ John Smith               ] [+] [-]     bhance    8/8/23
					Notes [ hillsboro oregon fence   ] [+] [-]     rjones    8/10/23
				Should we show the most recent editor for each thief on the thief list page?
				How important is all of this history logging?
